# Weather App

The app displays Current tempreture, Minimum tempreture, Maximum tempreture, Sunrise and Sunset time, Wind speed, Humidity percentage by using the device's location(longitude & latitude).

The app asks for user's permission to switch on the Locations (if not already done)

This app uses Retrofit library to download and parse JSON data from an API and also uses DEXTER library to display dialog box and ask for user permission.
